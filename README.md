# Adversarial Attacks and Defense for Non-Parametric TSTs

This repository provides codes for ICML 2022 paper: **Adversarial Attacks and Defense for Non-Parametric Two-Sample Tests** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03077) *Xilie Xu\*, Jingfeng Zhang\*, Feng Liu, Masashi Sugiyama, Mohan Kankanhalli*

## Requirements
This implementation is based on the following packages:
+ Python 3.8
+ PyTorch 1.11
+ CUDA 11.3
+ [Freqopttest](https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test) (This is a package for implementing ME and SCF tests. You can install it via ```pip install git+https://github.com/wittawatj/interpretable-test```)
+ Numpy

## Datasets
Following the setting of [MMD-D](https://github.com/fengliu90/DK-for-TST), before running the code on Higgs and MNIST, you need to download higgs and fake_mnist datasets from the following links:
+ fake_mnist (generated by DCGAN): https://drive.google.com/open?id=13JpGbp7PEm4PfZ6VeqpFiy0lHfVpy5Z5

+ higgs data (need pickle to load): https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sHIIFCoHbauk6Mkb6e8a_tp1qnvuUOCc
